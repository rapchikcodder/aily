# Extension Icons

## Required Icon Sizes

The Chrome Extension requires the following icon sizes:
- 16x16 pixels (browser toolbar)
- 48x48 pixels (extensions management page)
- 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Temporary Placeholder

For development purposes, you can use the icon-placeholder.svg as a temporary icon.

## Production Icons

Before publishing, replace these placeholder icons with professionally designed icons that:
1. Clearly represent the "Prompt Architect" concept
2. Look good at all sizes
3. Follow Chrome Web Store design guidelines
4. Use the brand color scheme (primary blue from Tailwind config)

## Design Suggestions

Icon concept ideas:
- A speech bubble with a construction/architecture symbol
- A thought bubble with building blocks
- A question mark morphing into a lightbulb
- Stacked layers representing prompt building
